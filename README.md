# Parkrun

A simple game written in Godot uwing GD Script where you control a dog driving a car through a park avoiding hedges. It's like flappy bird but vertical.

All pixel art was created by myself, the music and sounds effects are credited in the game to their owners.

Written for my nephew and neice.
